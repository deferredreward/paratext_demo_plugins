### Requirements

* [**MonoDevelop**](http://www.monodevelop.com/)

* [Linux Paratext](http://paratext.org) version 7.4 or newer.

* [Mecurial](http://mercurial.selenic.com) ([TortoiseHg](http://tortoisehg.bitbucket.org) is highly recommended).

### Getting the demo plugin code

* Clone the Hg repository to this new directory using [https://bitbucket.org/paratext/paratext-demo-plugins](https://bitbucket.org/paratext/paratext-demo-plugins) as your source directory

### Setting up the coding environment

* With MonoDevelop, open the solution file **ParatextDemoPlugins.sln** which should now be located in the root of the repository (i.e. the new directory you created).

### Getting the projects to build

For each of the projects:

* Remove the references to **AddInViews**, **System.AddIn** and **System.AddIn.Contract**

* Add new references to 
```
#!bash

/usr/lib/Paratext/Pipeline/AddInViews/AddInViews.dll
/usr/lib/Paratext/System.AddIn.dll
```

Uncheck LocalCopy (Right click on reference and untick LocalCopy) for each new reference. 

* At this point you should be able to compile all 4 demo projects. Ignore any build error generated by xcopy failing to install the plugins. You will install them yourself in the next section.

### Installing the Plugins

On Linux one can install the plugins into your Paratext by running install.sh

Run

```
#!bash

sudo ./install.sh Debug
```

(or Replace Debug with Release if you have built for release)

### Running the demo projects

You can try out a plugin by opening Paratext.

* The “Tip of the Day” plug-in should run automatically.

* To run the “Hello World” plugin: on the **Tools** menu, point to **Advanced**, and then click **Hello World Demo Menu Plugin**.

* To run the “Project Text Editor” plugin: on the **Tools** menu and then click **Project Text Editor**.

* To run the “Chapter Word Cloud” plugin: on the **Tools** menu and then click **Chapter Word Cloud**.


### Mono/Linux Limitations

* Due to a mono Limitation plugins must be build with the same .net framework as paratext uses.
* For PT 7.4 use .net 3.5
* For PT 7.5 use .net 4.0
